    "## Project Overview\n",
    "In this project, we aim to provide insights for Microsoft's new movie studio by analyzing movie data from Box Office Mojo and TMDB. The business problem is to understand which types of films are currently successful at the box office. We will use the bom.movie_gross.csv and tmdb.movies.csv datasets to explore film genres, ratings, and earnings. Our analysis will involve data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using pandas and seaborn. Based on our findings, we will offer recommendations to help Microsoft decide what types of films to produce."
